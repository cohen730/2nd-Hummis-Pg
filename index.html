                    <p>The History faculty strives to make outstanding scholarly contributions to the discipline and to
                        instill historical knowledge, perspective on human experience, critical thinking skills, and
                        effective writing in all our graduate and undergraduate students. We are also a community of
                        citizens engaged in service and devoted to the enrichment of intellectual and public life at the
                        University, throughout Utah, and beyond.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>We offer the B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees. History students can explore periods and regions
                        ranging from ancient Mesopotamia, Greece, and Rome to the modern Middle East, Asia, Europe, and
                        the Americas. Our faculty specializes in topics that include politics, diplomacy, warfare, and
                        intellectual life as well as gender and women’s history, medicine and science, colonialism and
                        intercultural contact, religious expression and practices, and environmental history. Our
                        curriculum reflects long-standing disciplinary tradition in its organization by region,
                        nation-state, and time period, but it also embodies a newer orientation toward transnational,
                        comparative, and thematic courses. Faculty involvement in Middle
                        Eastern Studies, Gender Studies, Asian Studies, Ethnic Studies, International Studies, Latin
                        American Studies, and Environmental Studies reflects the department’s longstanding commitment to
                        interdisciplinary programs.</p>


                    <p>History courses emphasize written and oral skills, analysis and critical thinking, and the
                        ability to assess conflicting interpretations. These skills prepare students for the
                        responsibilities of citizenship and cultivate an awareness of the complexities of life. History
                        provides valuable preparation for careers in university and college teaching and research,
                        primary and secondary education, law, government, public service, journalism, libraries and
                        museums, international business, and medicine.</p>
